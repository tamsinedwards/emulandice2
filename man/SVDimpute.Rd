\title{SVD Imputation Algorithm for Matrix Completion}
\usage{
SVDimpute(X, k = NULL, pmin = 0.99, reltol = 0.001, maxit = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Numeric matrix containing missing values as `NA`.}

\item{k}{Desired rank.}

\item{pmin}{Minimum proportional variation, used to set `k` if `k = NULL`, see Details.}

\item{reltol}{Relative tolerance for exit condition, see Details.}

\item{maxit}{Maximum number of iterations, see Details.}
}
\value{
A matrix like `X` but with the `NA`s imputed, plus an attributes `k` and `niter`, the number of iterations.
}
\description{
Replace `NA` values in matrix `X` with imputed values.  Order `X` with time or equivalent down the rows, because the imputation is done row by row.

Although `k` can be specified directly, it is safer to set it indirectly using `pmin`.
}
\details{
The algorithm exits if:

1. There has been `maxit` iterations.
2. The norm of the change in the imputed values starts to rise.
3. The norm of the change in the imputed values falls below `reltol` times the norm of `X` (after scaling).

If `k` is not specified, the value of `k` is calculated from the SVD of `X` after it has been centered and scaled and `NA` values have been imputed using row means.  `k` is the smallest value for which the proportion of variation is at least `pmin`.
